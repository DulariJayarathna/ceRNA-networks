# ceRNA-networks
We construct shared ceRNA networks for selected commonly diagnosed hormonal cancers
#Here we have constructed two types of ceRNA networks, 1. lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA and 2. pseudogene-miRNA-mRNA networks.
The lncRNA-associated ceRNA networks were built up using GDCRNATools R package. We implemented our own R-script for pseudogene-related networks following methodology described in GDCRNATools original paper.
